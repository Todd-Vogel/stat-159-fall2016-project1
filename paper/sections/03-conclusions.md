##Conclusions

In the end I found this project incredibly valuable.  Reproducible research, in my opinion, now appears like a much less daunting task.  By simply learning to command six fairly easy computational tools one can not only conduct research in a reproducible way, but also present it to the public for effective review. To anyone hoping to learn these techniques I highly recommend conducting a project such as this one.  Clearly, this project allowed me to further develop my skills in terminal, markdown, pandoc, make, git, and GitHub through the creation of this final product.  Though, somewhat unexpectedly, writing the essay also served to improve my understanding of the computational methods utilized.  By writing my steps down, and summarizing the purpose of each tool I came to comprehed each of their unique benefits on a deeper level.  More importantly, this essay introduced me to the concept of how interconnected each tool is and, therefore, how much more valuable they become when used together.
