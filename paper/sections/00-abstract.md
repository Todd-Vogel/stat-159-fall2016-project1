##Abstract

Many researchers often lack a simple pathway to learn the various tools to construct reproducible research.  However, learning the correct procedure to construct reproducible research is not difficult just multifaceted as students in Statistics 159, a course on reproducible and collaborative statistical data science at UC Berkeley, have learned. Those lessons will be passed on here.

For broad overview, first, one must learn how to utilize tools including terminal, markdown, pandoc, makefile, git, and github. Together, each of these components work to develop a streamlined system of file and directory structuring, document formation, and communal sharing.  After learning the purpose, and then, the methods of utilizing each tool researchers can then work towards more easily reproducible research.  In this paper, I will attempt to clarify the explicit purpose of the aforementioned tools and the steps in the process of sharing data and other information.
